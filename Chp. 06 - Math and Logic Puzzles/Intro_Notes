P(A and B) = P(B|A) P(A)		
P(A or B)  = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)		

Independence       --> P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)		
Mutually Exclusive --> P(A and B) = 0, so P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)		

Two events cannot be both independent and mutually exclusive (provided both have 
probabilities greater than 0). Why? Because mutual exclusivity means that if one 
happens then the other cannot. Independence, however, says that one event happening 
means absolutely nothing about the other event. Thus, as long as two events have 
non-zero probabilities, they will never be both mutually exclusive and independent.
