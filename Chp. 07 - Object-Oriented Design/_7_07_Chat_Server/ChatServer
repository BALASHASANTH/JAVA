7.7 - Chat Server

Class: Conversation (with subclasses GroupChat and PrivateChat). User. AddRequest.
----------------------------------- important lesson of when to use ArrayList vs. HashMap
    For fast lookup, book used:
        private HashMap<Integer, User> usersByld;
        private HashMap<String, User> usersByAccountName;
        private HashMap<Integer, User> onlineUsers;

    Uses: HashMap<Integer, PrivateChat> privateChats, 
          HashMap<Integer, AddRequest> receivedAddRequests
          HashMap<Integer, User> contacts
          ...I think using ArrayList instead of HashMap for these may have its own pros/cons. Maybe like this:
          ArrayList<PrivateChat> privateChats
          ArrayList<AddRequest> receivedAddRequests
          ArrayList<User> contacts
    "Tough problems to solve": Security, out-of-sync data / conflicting information.
