9.2 - Social Network

- Use BFS to find (shortest) path between 2 people.
- To Handle the Millions of Users (which won't fit on one machine)
    - Server Should have:
        - HashMap<Integer, Machine> machines (which maps machine's ID to the actual machine)
        - HashMap<lnteger, Integer> personToMachineMap (which maps person's ID to machine's ID)
    - Machine should have:
        - HashMap<Integer, Person> persons (which maps person's ID to Person)
- Optimization: Reduce Machine Jumps - Look up 5 things at once instead of 1 by 1 (see book for details)
