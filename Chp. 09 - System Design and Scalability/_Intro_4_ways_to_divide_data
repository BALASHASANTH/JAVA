4 ways to divide data (Read book's explanation for great tips)
    - by order of appearance (Benefit: won't ever need more machines than necessary)
    - by hashing it mod number of machines (Benefit: Every machine knows exactly where data is)
    - by using what the actual values represent. Can group similar things together, like all people in Mexico.
    - arbitrarily (Benefit: better load balancing)
