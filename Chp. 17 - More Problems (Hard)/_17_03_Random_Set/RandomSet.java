/*      (From book)
    Suppose we have an algorithm that can pull a random set of m elements from an array
    of size n - 1. How can we use this algorithm to pull a random set of m elements from
    an array of size n?

    We can first pull a random set of size m from the first n - 1 elements. Then, we just need
    to decide if array[n] should be inserted into our subset (which would require pulling
    out a random element from it). An easy way to do this is to pick a random number k
    from 0 through n. If k < m, then insert array[n] into subset [k].This will both "fairly"
    (i.e., with proportional probability) insert array[n] into the subset and "fairly"remove
    a random element from the subset.

    (Book's iterative solution of the above recursive explanation is below)

            if (rand < m) {                             // There's "rand / m" percent chance that the new element will be put into array
