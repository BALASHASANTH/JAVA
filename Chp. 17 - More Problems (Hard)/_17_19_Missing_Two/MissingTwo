Let's label the 2 missing numbers as "a" and "b".

Formula 1: Sum of 1 to n is (n)(n+1)/2
Formula 2: Sum of squares of 1 to n is 1^2 + 2^2 + .... n^2

We can calculate "ActualValue" by using the 2 formulas above, giving us:

ActualValue + a   + b   = (n)(n+1)/2
ActualValue + a^2 + b^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + .... n^2

Since ActualValue and "n" are both known, this gives us 2 formulas with 2 unknowns: a, b

We can solve these 2 equations for "a" and "b" (giving us the 2 missing numbers)

Note: We dont use 1*2*...*n as a formula since that will likely cause integer overflow
